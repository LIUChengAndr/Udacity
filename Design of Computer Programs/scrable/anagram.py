# Write a function, longest_words, that takes as input a hand, and a set 
# of letters on the board, and returns all word plays, the longest first.
# For testing, you can assume that you have access to a file called 
# 'words4k.txt'

# -----------------
# User Instructions
# 
# This homework deals with anagrams. An anagram is a rearrangement 
# of the letters in a word to form one or more new words. 
#
# Your job is to write a function anagrams(), which takes as input 
# a phrase and an optional argument, shortest, which is an integer 
# that specifies the shortest acceptable word. Your function should
# return a set of all the possible combinations of anagrams. 
#
# Your function should not return every permutation of a multi word
# anagram: only the permutation where the words are in alphabetical
# order. For example, for the input string 'ANAGRAMS' the set that 
# your function returns should include 'AN ARM SAG', but should NOT 
# include 'ARM SAG AN', or 'SAG AN ARM', etc...

# Helpful functions
# 
# You may find the following functions useful. These functions
# are identical to those we defined in lecture.

# Run the function test() to see if your function behaves as expected.
